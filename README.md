# Generative Artwork By Ryan Rizzo

- Recursion
This program generates a piece of art using a tile system. Each quadrent of each tile will have a random shape, or will create a new tile of a quarter the size.

- Displacement
This program generates a piece of art using rectangles with randomized displacement, size, color, and opacity. Texture is added to some rectangles using circle noise.

- Gyration
This program generates a piece of art using loops which draw primitive shapes in a circle around the canvas. The image drawn can be altered by adjusting an assortment of varaibles. Additionally, the parameters can be shuffled by using RANDOMIZE.

- PathFinder
This program generates a piece of art using indivudual lines which which look for a coordinate they have not visited

# How to use & generate new artwork
- Step 1: Install processing for you system (https://processing.org/download)
- Step 2: Download any of the folders (ex. Recursion, Displacement, ...)
- Step 3: Open the .pde file
- Step 4: Adjust constants at the top of the file (ex. DIPLSAY_WIDTH, DISPLAY_HEIGHT, ...)
- Step 5: Click run and wait for the program to finish generating the art
- Step 6: The artwork created should be added to the folder you downloaded
- Step 7: If you want to keep this render, rename it, as the program will overwrite it otherwise
